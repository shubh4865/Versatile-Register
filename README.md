# Versatile-Register
The Versatile Register is a configurable 4-bit register module designed to support various data manipulation operations based on control inputs. It integrates multiple functionalities within a single module, making it adaptable for different tasks in digital circuits. This module combines the capabilities of four individual submodules: Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) Register, Counter, Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register, and Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The module can be configured to perform parallel data loading, counting, shifting, and feedback-based operations, controlled through specific input signals.
